My emacs files

Just checkout with

```
git clone https://github.com/rafadc/emacs.d .emacs.d
```

Also it is a good idea to add **personal_notes.org** to global gitignore.

The config file is self documented at the [settings.org](https://github.com/rafadc/emacs.d/blob/master/settings.org) file.

I've versioned a launch agent I use for macosx. You can install it with

``` shell
ln -s ~/.emacs.d/launch_agent/us.cyg.emacs.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/us.cyg.emacs.plist
```
