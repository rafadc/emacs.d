;; Extension for linum-mode to highlight current line number.
;;
;; To use this package, add these lines to your .emacs file:
;;     (require 'hlinum)
;; And by using M-x linum-mode, you can see line numbers
;; with highlighting current line number.
;;
;; You can customize the color of highlighting current line by
;; changing `linum-highlight-face'.

;;; Code:

(require 'linum)

(defface linum-highlight-face
    '((t (:inherit default :foreground "black"
          :background "gray")))
  "Face for highlighting current line"
  :group 'linum)

  (let (ret)
    (while (and (null ret) seq)
      (when (funcall predicate (car seq))
        (setq ret (car seq)))
      (setq seq (cdr seq)))
    ret))

(defun linum-color (face)
  "Highlight current line number by using face FACE."
